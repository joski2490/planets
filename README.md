Physics simulator in basic HTML/CSS/JS

This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

##Description

This app moves CSS dots around with gravity and collision detection, and can lead to lots of interesting clumping behavior. I made it with [@reem](https://github.com/reem) and our then-limited knowledge of JavaScript.
